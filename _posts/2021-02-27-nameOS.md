## Amy. Why did you do this?

Why not?

I was learning how to make an OS, mainly for fun cause I was bored during lockdown school (I had a free lesson). When I got home I decided to tweet this:

> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Reply to this tweet to get your own OS which does nothing but prints your name (or a message of your choice) to the screen!</p>&mdash; Amy (@amyabie) <a href="https://twitter.com/amyabIe/status/1364677769112731652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 24, 2021</a>

This was a lot of fun and made me actually add a decent printf to my kernel.

## Should I try make this?

Why not? Its a great learning experience, and you can have a lot of fun while doing it! You could start by learning how mine works by [looking at my source.](https://github.com/00p513-dev/nameOS)
